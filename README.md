# mask_detection_opencv_python
This is mask detection module made from python using computer vision 
There are 5 files including the README.md
Haarcascade is the classifier used to detect the frontal face which is then used by DataCollectro.py
DataCollector.py is a python file which help to collect the data for the preprocessig in data preprocessing.py
Datapreprocessing.py is the another python file which helps to pre process the data(images). I couldnt upload the image file due to large storage if you want to make your own image data you can use Datacollector.py 
For the preprocessing :
    First I converted the data(images) into numpy arrray using numpy library
    Then I splitted the data to X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test 
    I have used sequential model from keras.models
    Then trained and saved  the model as (My trainning model.h5)
train.py:
  It is a python trained file where we preditct the model
